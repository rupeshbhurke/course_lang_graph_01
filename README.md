## Notebook mapping

Quick guide to what each notebook contains and which parts of the course they map to:

- `Graph_01.ipynb` — Covers graph-related concepts used with language models; exercises and examples that follow the course's graph sections.
- `HelloWorld.ipynb` — Starter notebook for environment checks and simple "hello world" examples used at the beginning of the course.

## Optional workflow
Install them in a virtual environment (Windows, cmd.exe):

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Repository contents

- `Graph_01.ipynb` — Notebook exploring graph-related concepts used alongside language models (examples and exercises).
- `HelloWorld.ipynb` — Minimal starter notebook (hello world examples and environment checks).
- `LICENSE` — Project license file.

## Purpose

This repository holds small, self-contained Jupyter notebooks used for learning and demonstration. The notebooks are intended to be run locally in a Python environment with Jupyter installed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer is recommended.
- Jupyter (notebook or lab) to run the notebooks.

Optional (recommended) workflow using a virtual environment:

Windows (cmd.exe):

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyter
```

## How to open the notebooks

Start Jupyter Notebook (from repository root):

```cmd
python -m notebook
```

Or, if you prefer JupyterLab and have it installed:

```cmd
jupyter lab
```

Then open `Graph_01.ipynb` or `HelloWorld.ipynb` from the browser UI.

## Notes & assumptions

- These notebooks are small learning artifacts. They may contain explanatory text, example code cells, and exercises. If you run into missing dependencies, install them via `pip` as required.
- Assumed target audience: learners running notebooks locally on their machine.

## Contributing

Small fixes, improvements to notebooks, or README updates are welcome. Open a PR with changes.
